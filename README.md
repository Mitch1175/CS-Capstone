## Professional Self-Assessment

# Professional Goals and Values
Throughout my time at SNHU, I have learned technical principles, ethical boundaries, and basic techniques that will help me to grow as a developer in the field of Computer Science. It wasn’t just the artifacts that helped me to grow, but the overall outcome of large projects to small assignments that helped me achieve this final goal. Upon graduating, I am confident that my skills and work putting together my ePortfolio will help me to succeed and learn more in the future of the field.

I learned technical principles and how code works in different languages. I was able to leap over the first hurdle and learn the basics of coding and how to use it in simple programs. After that, I could take Java and Python, along with PowerShell, to alter a database and display the information in a fully functional website. I could take what I learned in C++ and use characteristics to create a 3D environment. All of the technological advances I have learned weren’t just how to code, it was how to use the code in the real world.

I learned about ethical boundaries. What concerns could creating a program entail? I was thrown back at the obstacles that programmers face when it comes to ethical and biased programming. In my last class, it threw all the ethical concerns I learned into a jar and mixed them with the possibility of artificial intelligence. When it comes to how machines learn from humans, they take ideas and inputs that we provide for them. It is a serious concern and after this program I am more aware of the possibilities and issues that regard ethics in programming.

I learned basic techniques that I can use in the future, as well as every day life. I brushed up on old techniques that I forgot or didn’t have a strong grasp on. I have written many papers, but brushing up on concentrating on the topics and using proper citations was good to instill back into my habits. The way I take on a project is now different by using small increments, rather than large portions at a time.

Learning how to collaborate in a team environment is crucial to the success of any project. As I have learned throughout my student career and professional career, communication is key to any task. Each team member is in charge of a different obstacle and staying in communication keeps everyone else on track to help each other and know where everyone else is. Communicating with stakeholders is important because it shows how serious or lazy you are. You professionalism to your superiors is crucial to your future in the field. This could also apply to clients that are pouring large amounts of money into your trust to complete the project correctly. 

Data structures and algorithms are important because it determines how a program is used and the complexity of it. Code must be clean and work accordingly, without hiccups. Complexity also means that clean code and reducing redundancy is an important aspect to implement.

Software engineering and databases are important because it provides the core of the project and how to access all of the desired data. It is important to make sure that the code works correctly and has all of the necessary components that the stakeholder has asked for. When accessing a database, it is crucial that both programs can communicate easily with each other and the data is easily accessible.

Easy accessibility is widely mistaken for broken security. All parts of a program should be secure from the public, from other employees, and from the backend team of programmers. Upon studying cybersecurity prior, I have learned that using the fundamental security design principles such as least privilege, layering, MFA, and isolation are all important aspects to consider. Security is an issue that not only affects the users, but it can affect the whole company, users outside the company, and even break laws. All information should be kept confidential, use integrity, and be available to the people that are allowed to access it.

#Artifacts and Outcomes
My artifacts were chosen according to the preliminary guidelines. I chose an artifact to add software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and databases. Upon completing these tasks, I can see my ePortfolio come to life and show how more professional I have become. When I do get a job in the Computer Science field, I will have an even better understanding of how to become even more professional.

In my first artifact, I decided to use my Inventory mobile app, designed in Java, to add features for software design and engineering. This app had a few different screens, or pages, that navigated from a login page, to an inventory page, and a settings page. I added an extra page that allowed the user to add a bio and change each page to light or dark, based on their preference. Overall, I used new concepts and broke barriers when it came to making a new page. Upon completing the bio page, I learned that I could perfect other areas of my original app even further, such as clearing the line after pressing enter and allowing a smoother transition when navigating between the pages. Overall, my artifact was a success.

In my second artifact, I used my clock app, designed in C++ for algorithms and data structure. This app would use a random time and allow the user to add hours, minutes, or seconds to change it. Overall, the app was messy and didn’t even work correctly. I ended up deleting almost 50 lines of code, as well as redundant extra code that didn’t need to be there. Upon adding a simple task to randomize the time differently, I didn’t need to convert the time from 12 and 24 hours into complicated code. Overall, my artifact was a success.

In my third artifact, I used my Inventory app once again, designed in Java, to add a database. This database added an extra page to search for other users that were inputted into the app. The users could be randomized, but I chose to make up ones using the NATO phonetic alphabet. The user will now be able to go to a search screen and search for their friends. Overall, my artifact was a success.

Through all three enhancements, I was able to use software design and engineering to add features to an already functioning mobile app. These changes dramatically changed how the app looks and works. I was able to use algorithms and data structure to clean up code and allow the app to run faster. Although 200 lines of code isn’t much, on a much larger scale the changes could be the difference between the app working or crashing. Lastly, I was able to create a database. Databases are important because it can store information in a secure spot that can be accessed and loaded when needed. These changes allowed me to think outside the box and learn new features that illustrated into new ideas that were not part of the original plan.

Throughout everything I have learned in this course and program, I am confident that I have completed and mastered all five of the course outcomes.

* *Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science

In the first artifact, I allowed the user to choose between light and dark in the app. The user could also add a bio to tell the world a little bit about themselves. In the third artifact, I constructed a database to allow users to search for any user in the database that they wanted to see. These developments meet the course outcome.

* *Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts

In the first and second artifact, I cleaned up the code and added more comments to support how I made the app function correctly. These cleanups were necessary because when working with larger projects, it can get hard to read and redundant code can bog the program down. These developments meet the course outcome.

* *Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices

In all three artifacts, I recoded certain parts of the programs to solve problems and allow the programs to function properly. In the first artifact, I cleaned up the code and allowed the user to navigate the pages more efficiently. In the second artifact, I changed the random number algorithm to get rid of redundant code. In the third artifact, I used a database to allow the user a way to search for screen names. These developments meet the course outcome.

* *Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals

In all of the artifacts, I used techniques, skills, and tools to implement solutions and deliver the correct outcome. In the first artifact I allowed the user to navigate the pages correctly, change their bio, and choose between light and dark. In the second artifact, I deleted redundant code to provide a smoother outcome when the program was running. In the third artifact, I created a database that allowed for the correct users to be provided, at lightning speed, upon the user’s request. These developments meet the course outcome. 

* *Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources

In the third artifact, I used a list view and array list to keep the data contained. The database was not left to the open, but contained. If need be, security protocols can be added to provide some usernames to be hidden. In this case, it was not needed. These developments meet the course outcomes.
